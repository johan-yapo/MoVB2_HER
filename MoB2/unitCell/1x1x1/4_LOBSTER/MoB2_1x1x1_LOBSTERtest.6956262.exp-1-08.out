WARNING: stop here and check the manual. Please Prepare a k-point grid that spans EITHER the whole
WARNING: Brillouin zone (i.e. without symmetry) or half of the Brillouin zone 
WARNING: (i.e. only time reversal symmetry) and restart your quantum-mechanical calculation

WARNING: There is a syntax error in a cohpgenerator line in the lobsterin file.
WARNING: ignoring line "cohpGenerator"
WARNING: You did not specify any COHP pairs in the lobsterin file. As default
WARNING: I will try to find any pairs between 1.0 and 3.0 A distance,
WARNING: but that might be wrong. If you want pCOHPs or pCOOPs, change the lobsterin!
