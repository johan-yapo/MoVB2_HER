#Computational settings

LPLANE=.FALSE. #switches on the plane-wise data distribution in real space. TRUE., the data distribution in real space is done plane wise.
NCORE=2 #determines determines the number of compute cores that work on an individual orbital.
LSCALU=.FALSE. #switches on the parallel LU decomposition (using scaLAPACK) in the orthonormalization of the wave functions.
NSIM=4 #NSIM sets the number of bands that are optimized simultaneously by the RMM-DIIS algorithm.

#Initialization
#GGA=RP #Determines which GGA DFT funnctional we want to use. RP=RPBE, RE=revPBE ,B3/B5=B3LYP.
ALGO=fast #Determines which algorithm is used to optimize orbitals. Similar to ALGO=normal, fast, or very_fast
#IALGO=38 #=38 same as normal or fast ALGO
ISTART=0 # 1 read WAVECAR if it exists
ICHARG=2 # determines how VASP constructs the initial charge density. 11 to read from an available CHGCAR file.
LAECHG=.TRUE. #the all-electron charge density will be reconstructed explicitly and written out to file. AECCAR0, AECCAR1, AECCAR2 are written. may be important for Bader.
LCHARG=.TRUE. #Determines whether the charge densities are recorded in CHGCAR and CHG.
PREC=accurate #specifies the "precision"-mode
#ISYM=0 #Switches off the use of symmetry except psi=its complex conjugate. =-1 switches it off completely

#Electronic Optimization

LREAL=.FALSE. #determines whether the projection operators are evaluated in real-space or in reciprocal space.
NELM=200 #sets the maximum number of electronic SC (selfconsistency) steps which may be performed.
NELMIN=5 #specifies the minimum number of electronic SCF steps. Ideally between 4-8.
EDIFF=1E-06 #global break condition for the electronic SC-loop. Convergence criteria.
ENCUT=500.00 #specifies the cutoff energy for the planewave basis set in eV. should be ~1-1.3x of largest ENMAX atom in cell.

#Ionic relaxation

NSW=60 #sets the maximum number of ionic steps. >0 for relaxations.
IBRION=2 #determines how the ions are updated and moved. =2 default for relaxations, =-1 for energy calculations
ISIF=3 #determines whether the stress tensor is calculated and which principal degrees-of-freedom are allowed to change in relaxation, =2 only atoms are relaxed, =3 both atoms and unit cells are relaxed.
EDIFFG=-0.02 #defines the break condition for the ionic relaxation loop. -0.02 A/ev. >0 energym <0 force.

#Magnetism

#MAGMOM = 6*0 6*0 3*0 3*3 #Specifies the initial magnetic moment for each atom, if and only if ICHARG=2, or if ICHARG=1 and the CHGCAR file contains no magnetisation density.

#DOS
LORBIT=11  #together with an appropriate RWIGS, determines whether the PROCAR or PROOUT files are written.
#NEDOS=1601 #specifies number of gridpoints on which the (Desnsity of states) DOS is evaluated. should be 1500 to 3000
#EMIN=-12 #specifies the lower boundary of the energy range for the evaluation of the DOS
#EMAX=18
#LWAVE=.FALSE. #determines whether the wavefunctions are written to the WAVECAR file at the end of a run.
